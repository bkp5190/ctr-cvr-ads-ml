# ðŸ“ˆ CTR/CVR Modeling for Meal Ads

## Background
- This repository hosts a model on streamlit which predicts the predict Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
with LLM-generated food ad interaction data. This demo serves as an exploration of the food ads space in an ML context. 

## Model Explanation
- The underlying models are gradient boosting classifiers from scikit-learn.
- The first model will attempt to predict if a user will click on a certain advertisement (CTR).
- The second model will attempt to predict the conversion rate (CVR) of a clicked through user on a certain advertisement.

## Industry Relevance
- Although these models and notebooks serve as an initial exploration of the space, the foundation concepts remain the same for 
production models.
